#### enthusiastic Cybersecurity analyst
(![github](Red Grey Hacker Desktop Wallpaper.png))
Dynamic professional with a solid foundation in Food & Beverage Management, now fully
committed to a career in technology following a successful transition into the IT sector. After a
significant event in late 2022, I redirected my focus and completed a comprehensive technology
boot camp with Masterschool, inspired by my brother's career in cybersecurity. My background
as a head chef has honed my problem-solving abilities, attention to detail, and leadership skills,
all of which are vital in the IT field. Fluent in five languages English, Spanish, Italian, German, and
Portuguese I bring a global perspective and excellent communication skills. I am now eager to
apply my passion for technology and newly acquired expertise in IT support, SOC analysis, or as
a Junior Cybersecurity Analyst, where I can contribute to safeguarding digital environments
